                    <p style={{fontSize:20}}> Imagine for a moment that, similar to useState and useEffect, there was a built-in useOnlineStatus Hook. Then both of these components could be simplified and you could remove the duplication between them: </p>

                        <CodeSnippet code={sampleCode}  language="javascript"/>

                    <p style={{fontSize:20}}> Although there is no such built-in Hook, you can write it yourself. Declare a function called useOnlineStatus and move all the duplicated code into it from the components you wrote earlier: </p>
                    <div>

                <AccordionDetails>
                    <p style={{fontSize:20}}> React applications are built from components. Components are built from Hooks, whether built-in or custom. You’ll likely often use custom Hooks created by others, but occasionally you might write one yourself! </p>
                    <p style={{fontSize:20}}> You must follow these naming conventions: </p>
                    <p style={{fontSize:20}}> 1.React component names must start with a capital letter, like StatusBar and SaveButton. React components also need to return something that React knows how to display, like a piece of JSX. </p>
                    <p style={{fontSize:20}}> 2.Hook names must start with use followed by a capital letter, like useState (built-in) or useOnlineStatus (custom, like earlier on the page). Hooks may return arbitrary values. </p>

                    <p style={{fontSize:20}}> This convention guarantees that you can always look at a component and know where its state, Effects, and other React features might “hide”. For example, if you see a getColor() function call inside your component, you can be sure that it can’t possibly contain React state inside because its name doesn’t start with use. However, a function call like useOnlineStatus() will most likely contain calls to other Hooks inside! </p>

                <AccordionDetails>
                    <p style={{fontSize:20}}> In the earlier example, when you turned the network on and off, both components updated together. However, it’s wrong to think that a single isOnline state variable is shared between them. Look at this code: </p>
                    <div>
                        <CodeSnippet code={sampleCode3}  language="javascript"/>

                        <CodeSnippet code={sampleCode4}  language="javascript"/>

                    <p style={{fontSize:20}}> These are two completely independent state variables and Effects! They happened to have the same value at the same time because you synchronized them with the same external value (whether the network is on). </p>
                    <p style={{fontSize:20}}> Custom Hooks let you share stateful logic but not state itself. Each call to a Hook is completely independent from every other call to the same Hook.  </p>

                <AccordionDetails>
                    <p style={{fontSize:20}}> You don’t need to extract a custom Hook for every little duplicated bit of code. Some duplication is fine. For example, extracting a useFormInput Hook to wrap a single useState call like earlier is probably unnecessary. </p>
                    <p style={{fontSize:20}}> However, whenever you write an Effect, consider whether it would be clearer to also wrap it in a custom Hook. You shouldn’t need Effects very often, so if you’re writing one, it means that you need to “step outside React” to synchronize with some external system or to do something that React doesn’t have a built-in API for. Wrapping it into a custom Hook lets you precisely communicate your intent and how the data flows through it. </p>
                    <p style={{fontSize:20}}> For example, consider a ShippingForm component that displays two dropdowns: one shows the list of cities, and another shows the list of areas in the selected city. You might start with some code that looks like this: </p>

                    <div>
                        <CodeSnippet code={sampleCode5}  language="javascript"/>
                    </div>
                    <p style={{fontSize:20}}> Although this code is quite repetitive, it’s correct to keep these Effects separate from each other. They synchronize two different things, so you shouldn’t merge them into one Effect. Instead, you can simplify the ShippingForm component above by extracting the common logic between them into your own useData Hook: </p>
                    <div>
                        <CodeSnippet code={sampleCode6}  language="javascript"/>
                    </div>
                    <p style={{fontSize:20}}> Now you can replace both Effects in the ShippingForm components with calls to useData: </p>
                    <div>
                        <CodeSnippet code={sampleCode7}  language="javascript"/>
                    </div>
                    <p style={{fontSize:20}}> Extracting a custom Hook makes the data flow explicit. You feed the url in and you get the data out. By “hiding” your Effect inside useData, you also prevent someone working on the ShippingForm component from adding unnecessary dependencies to it. With time, most of your app’s Effects will be in custom Hooks. </p>
